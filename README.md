🚀 Project Highlight: Land Registration System with Blockchain 🌐

I’m thrilled to share a project I’ve been working on - a Land Registration System that leverages Blockchain Technology to revolutionize the land registry process!

🏡 Problem Statement: Land registration in many regions is slow, prone to fraud, and susceptible to the loss of paperwork. The current system can be inconvenient and insecure, leading to fraudulent claims and inefficiency.

🛠 Solution: We developed a Land Registration System using Blockchain to create a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger for land transactions. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures secure storage of land records, decreasing the chances of fraud and enhancing transparency in the registration process.

🔗 How it Works:

Buyers, Sellers, and Land Inspectors can securely transfer land ownership and verify land details.
The blockchain ledger ensures that all transactions are recorded permanently, enhancing trust and security in the system.
💻 Tech Stack: 
Frontend:
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* CSS
* Metamask Chrome Extension for secure blockchain transactions

Backend:
* Ethereum Blockchain (Truffle Suite)
* Solidity for smart contracts
* Ganache for local blockchain simulation

📋 Key Features:

* Registration & User Profiles: Buyers & Sellers can register, and their profiles can be managed easily.
* Land Inspector Dashboard: Works as an admin, verifying users and approving land transfers.
* Land Management: Sellers can add land, approve buyer requests, and buyers can view and request land ownership.
* Ownership Transfer: Automated land ownership transfer via smart contracts after all approvals are complete.
* Payment Integration: Secure payment system to finalize land transactions.


🚀 Steps to Run the Project:
* Clone the GitHub repository.
* Launch Ganache and ensure Metamask is installed.
* Run truffle migrate --reset to deploy smart contracts.
* Navigate to the client folder and run npm install.
* Start the application with npm start.
